# SkyBlockXT

  Cant find a Working Skyblock plugin for your Minecraft servers? here is one for you!
  
  With a world generator that creates up to 100 island in just 1 World! no more Live, Laggy islands!
  since it will be creating 100 islands, no need to Create a island everytime a user wants to! now just /is create
  will only Configure the island for the player and thats it ! no more generating!
  
  With a Anti-Troll [WIP] System, players wont kill other player within their islands, but why?
  and example, they create a little shop in their island, but where the player spawns, there is lava and traps!
  so he would die inmediatly!, but, with this system they Can't attack others and they can't be attacked by
  a amount of time setted by you! its like they are invincibles for 5 minutes! but if they fall down, they die, derp
  
  and more much features planned coming by its way! wait for further release to get the Stable and working plugin!
  
  
##TODO
Dont forget to read the TODO list! here the [Link](https://github.com/XenoNova/SkyBlockXT/issues/17)
  
## Island Concept:
  This is how the island will  be generated **after*** PRE-ALPHA Release!
![Concept](http://static.planetminecraft.com/files/resource_media/screenshot/1301/skyblock_4567067.jpg)
### Planned PRE-ALPHA Release Date: *15/04/16* - *20/04/16*
> After* = The concept will be creatd AFTER the release, or within development of PRE-ALPHA to ALPHA Milestone

## [IMPORTANT] SkyKey 32b & 64b, the new SkyblockXT Secure Encryption
Whats SkyKey? and what its reason of it?
Since we had know there has been hackers on servers and gaming
not everyone liked that, so AntiHacking systems were made and Ecryption was used
more often, SkyKey will Encrypt users data and Economy information also backups passwords

So if your servers gets hacked or your VPS or Some random crap, they will not be able to modify
Skyblock Information neither Backups, since the Plugin will encrypt the information to a 32 bits,
but after PRE-ALPHA, i will start using 64 bit encryption and in ALPHA 128 bit and in BETA 256,
if on official Release we get any better encryption we will use that, but after the ALPHA release
this will be trigger able so user can have less protection on local servers or something, if you dont want
this, tell us now to remove this feature, more info will be given later
