# SkyBlockXT

  Cant find a Working Skyblock plugin for your Minecraft servers? here is one for you!
  
  With a world generator that creates up to 100 island in just 1 World! no more Live, Laggy islands!
  since it will be creating 100 islands, no need to Create a island everytime a user wants to! now just /is create
  will only Configure the island for the player and thats it ! no more generating!
  
  With a Anti-Troll [WIP] System, players wont kill other player within their islands, but why?
  and example, they create a little shop in their island, but where the player spawns, there is lava and traps!
  so he would die inmediatly!, but, with this system they Can't attack others and they can't be attacked by
  a amount of time setted by you! its like they are invincibles for 5 minutes! but if they fall down, they die, derp
  
  and more much features planned coming by its way! wait for further release to get the Stable and working plugin!
  
  
## Island Concept:
  This is how the island will  be generated after ALPHA Release!
